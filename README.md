## 🎯 Goals
By the end of this lab you will be able to...

- Create an API key
- Read API documentation to understand how to make requests, either in GitHub docs or using the examples on the organization’s website
- Use the useEffect() hook as a replacement for previous mount/unmount functions
- Fetch API data with async/await syntax
- Use props to send variable data to a component for use in a variety of use cases
- Use conditional rendering, either with if statements or ternary operators, to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not
- Additionally practice using CSS to format pages
